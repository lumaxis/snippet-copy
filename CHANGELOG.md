# Change Log

## [0.3.1]

### Fixes

- Exclude unnecessary files from published file, reducing its size.

## [0.3.0]

### Features

- Rename VS Code commands to be shorter and more concise.
    - `Copy Snippet Without Leading Indentation` is now `Copy Snippet`
    - `Copy Snippet Without Leading Indentation as Markdown Code Block` is now `Copy Snippet as Markdown Code Block`
- Improve configuration options for Markdown code blocks
  - Add `markdownCodeBlock.includeLanguageIdentifier` configuration option for Markdown block behavior. **This replaces `snippet-copy.addLanguageIdentifierToMarkdownBlock`**. 
  - Allows to set whether Markdown blocks should always include the [language identifier](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) which allows for syntax highlighting in some tools (for example github.com) but is not compatible with others (for example Slack).  
  - The default is "`prompt`" which makes the extension always prompt when using the "Copy Snippet as Markdown Code Block" command.
- Add configuration setting to convert tabs to spaces when copying snippet. Additionally allows to configure the tab size for the conversion.
